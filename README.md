# VersionProxy

A cross-version proxy for Minecraft. Not intended for use, just to show how stupid this idea is.

I guess it could work for simple shit though

The difference between this and McJty's CompatLayer is that this is an actual proxy and not a library built for each version. The same jar would work across all MC versions.

The implementation is similar to `@SidedProxy`
